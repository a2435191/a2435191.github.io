# First problem
[Today](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4), each line in the input represents two integer ranges (sections) separated by a comma. We are asked to determine how many pairs of sections have one fully contain the other.

While reading the problem description, I thought this might be the [overlapping intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/) problem. That would have been quite the difficulty spike compared to yesterday's problems!

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day04_1.py %}
```

I thought about taking a page out of my friend [Connor](https://cmorrey.live/projects#)'s book and writing a super terse, regex-based solution, but I'm still emphasizing readability, at least for now.


# Second problem
I was still holding out hope that the second problem would be a dynamic programming challenge, but we just need to consider intervals that overlap at all now.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day04_2.py %}
```

I do wish Python had better functional programming support; as opposed to having to update a counter myself, it would be nice if I could throw my logic into a count function that takes a predicate. Multi-line anonymous functions would also be great.
