# First problem
[Our communication device](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) is malfunctioning, and we need to find the first four characters in an ASCII string that all differ (the start-of-packet marker), and return the index of the fourth of those characters. 

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day06_1.py %}
```

If the substring length were longer, we could make an optimization to advance the index counter `i` past where the first duplicate is found in each loop, but with the four-character substrings it's not necessary.

# Second problem
We now need to look for fourteen-length markers, with the same procedure as above. Still not enough to optimize our sliding window, though.
```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day06_2.py %}
```
