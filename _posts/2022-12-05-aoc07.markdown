# First problem
[This](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) is the first algorithmic problem. We are given a newline-delimited list of pseudo-shell instructions (just `ls` and `cd`) and must first sum up the sizes of all directories with greater than `MAX_SIZE = 100_000` bytes. First, we keep track of all the nodes in the tree with a data structure and build up the tree.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day07_common.py %}
```

Then we traverse the tree to find all directories with total size not greater than `MAX_SIZE`. One unused optimization is starting at a leaf node and working up— then any node with running total size greater than `MAX_SIZE` can be skipped.


```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day07_1.py %}
```

Thank God that worked. That was a significant difficulty spike, and I need to get better at working with trees.

# Second problem

Now we must compute the total size of the outermost directory `total_dir_size`, subtract `40_000_000`, find the smallest directory with size at least this number for deletion, and return the size of that directory.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day07_2.py %}
```

Parsing the tree in the first problem was the trickiest part. After that, it was fairly straightforward. I resisted the urge to stay up all night rewriting recursion as beautiful iteration— after all, I don't need to roll my own stack when my machine's call stack works just fine.

It's 4:19 AM here and I have class tomorrow. I'm going to bed.
