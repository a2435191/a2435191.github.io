# First problem
[We need](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) to read a two-column list of instructions describing a game of rock-paper-scissors and calculate a total score from each game: in the second column, X (you play Rock) is 1 point, Y is 2, and Z is 3; call this the `strategy_score`. Winning against the opponent (who similarly picks A, B, or C in column 1) adds 6 points, 3 for a draw, and 0 for a loss; call this the `win_score`.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day02_1.py %}
```

# Second problem
Now it turns out that the second column actually represents the outcome of the game: X is a loss, Y is a draw, and Z is a win.

Noticing that the permutation of `(rock, paper, scissors)` that always beats `(rock, paper, scissors)` is `(paper, scissors, rock)`— shifting right by 1— helps avoid a lot of casework.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day02_2.py %}
```
