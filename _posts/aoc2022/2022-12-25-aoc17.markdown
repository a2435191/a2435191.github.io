# First problem
[Today](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17), we return to more simulation problems, this time simulating a sort of Tetris game. It is important to realize that the gas jets, which cause the left and right motion of the falling rocks, do not reset after each rock.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day17_common.py %}
```

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day17_1.py %}
```

# Second problem
Unfortunately, the second problem requires simulating a trillion rocks. The simulation used earlier is simply not up to the task.
```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day17_2.py %}
```
