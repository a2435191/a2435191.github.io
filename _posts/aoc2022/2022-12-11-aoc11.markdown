# First problem
[Another state machine/simulation problem](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11)— three in a row! That's alright, I like these. Our input is several blocks like the following, divided by double newlines:
```
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3
```

Each monkey takes a turn in a round to inspect an item, the `worry` of which starts at the value listed in `Starting items`. Then the `Operation` is applied, and worry is `floordiv`-ed by three. The `Test` determines which monkey each item is thrown to.

We must return the number of items the two most prolific monkeys interact with, multiplied together.

To simulate this process, we must first write a (crude) parser to extract the initial state. This is put in a common file because I suspect we will need it in the second problem as well.
```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day11_common.py %}
```

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day11_1.py %}
```

# Second problem

This time, we don't `floordiv` by 3 after every round, and there are 10,000 rounds. Unfortunately, this leads to absolutely *massive* values for each `worry`, which take a long time to do arithmetic on. Since the only thing that changes the flow of the state machine is the divisiblity test, we need to find some function `f(n)` that significantly shrinks `n` and is invariant under the modulo operation of linear combinations of `n`— that is, `f(a * n + b) % k == (a * n + b) % k`. One such function is taking the modulus of `n` and `k` (since `n % k < k`, in `(n % k) % k` the second `% k` has no effect, so it equals `n % k`). But there are multiple values of `k`, with each `k` representing one of the divisibility test divisors. Therefore, our `modulus` is just the least common multiple of all of the divisibility test divisors.
