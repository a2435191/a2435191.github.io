# First problem
[This problem](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) has us examine each line (rucksack), each half of which represents one compartment. We must find the single letter (item type) that appears one in both compartments and add up their prioritiesâ€” 1-26 for a-z, 27-62 for A-Z.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day03_1.py %}
```

# Second problem
All the world-building, while well-written, sometimes masks the actual problem at hand. This question is the exact same as previously, except now we repeat the procedure for every three lines (group of elves).

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day03_2.py %}
```
