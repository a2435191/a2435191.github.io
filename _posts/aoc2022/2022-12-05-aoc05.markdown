# First problem
In [today](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5)'s problem, we are given an arrangement of stacked characters (crates) and instructions on how to move them via crane. We must determine the order of the crates on the **top** of each stack after following the instructions.

The data structure [most optimum](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel.html) for this problem is a list of lists, with the inner-nested lists functioning as a stack type (fitting). Having established this, we may now write a function, `_extract_initial_state`, to extract the initial state of the problem from the first few lines of the text file by moving column-wise first. Then it is just a simple regex to parse the movement instructions, which take the format `move {quantity of crates} from {start position} to {end position}`.

```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day05_1.py %}
```

# Second problem
Now we are told that the crane actually moves all the stacks *in order* as opposed to one at a time, which is just a one line modification:
```python
{% include aoc2022/solutions/day05_2.py %}
```
